## Overivew
Drug-based allergic reactions affect 10% of the world's population and up to 20% of hospitalized patients. On top of that many patients, especially seniors, are prescribed conflicting drugs. With Sanus users can keep track of allergies and prescribed medications. Sanus automatically checks for drug and allergy conflicts as doctors prescribe medications. It also provides a standardized electonic medical record that doctors can review during appointments. This project was created at Hack the North 2016.
